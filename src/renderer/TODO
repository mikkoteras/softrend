Missing features
================

* Fuller .mtl file support; see http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/mtl/
* Add classes to encapsulate the solid color v. mapped color decision.
* Fix line plotting bugs:
    - z-lines near the horizon are botched.
* Fix triangle plotting bugs:
    - top y clipping breaks at least some shading models.
* Split light into diffuse and specular components.
* Implement Blinn-Phong.
* Add face/point/normal/etc counts to text overlay.
* The triange_render class screams for refactoring.
* color3, color4
* Bug: alpha icosa with no lights and illum 1 is not invisible, why?
* Rewrite include dir arrangement; #include "math/vector.h" instead of "vector.h".
