Missing features
================

* The triange_render_context class screams for refactoring. Maybe copy the surface_point data
  into the triangle object directly, so the halfpoly preparation can be done concurrently.
  The means getting rid of triangle_render_context entrirely.
* Add classes to encapsulate the solid color v. mapped color decision.
* Fix line plotting bugs:
    - z-lines near the horizon are botched.
* Fix triangle plotting bugs:
    - none known
* Implement Blinn-Phong.
* Bug: alpha icosa with no lights and illum 1 is not invisible, why?
* Rewrite include dir arrangement; #include "math/vector.h" instead of "vector.h".
* Fuller .mtl file support; see http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/mtl/
