Missing features
================

* Fuller .mtl file support; see http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/mtl/
* Phong etc shading.
* Fix line plotting bugs:
    - z-lines near the horizon are botched.
* Optimize triangle plotting
    - the entire vertex_data[vertex_index[edge[edge_index].top]]] scheme is demented
