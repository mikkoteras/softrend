Missing features
================

* Fuller .mtl file support; see http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/mtl/
* Phong etc shading.
* Fix line plotting bugs:
    - z-lines near the horizon are botched.
* Fix triangle plotting bugs:
    - some polys appear as protruding horizontal lines, why?
        - see top of teapot for an example
* Devise a better way on computing transformed normals (probably two matrix stacks)
